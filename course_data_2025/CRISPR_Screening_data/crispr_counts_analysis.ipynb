        "The aim of this practical class is to introduce you to some of the concepts and tools involved in the analysis of pooled CRISPR screens. We will begin by taking a set of pre-generated CRISPR counts data and exploring it in R. Then, we will process the dataset to identify essential genes in a cell line using a two popular tools: MAGeCK and BAGEL2. Finally, we will explore some alternative tools for CRISPR screen analysis and discuss some of the pitfalls that you might need to be wary of in these kinds of experiments.\n",

        "Throughout this course, you will hopefully have seen how CRISPR systems can be applied as powerful tools for cellular manipulation. Depending on how they are configured, CRISPR systems can be used to:\n",

        "🧬 **Design** 🧬\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we prepare a library of guide RNAs that target your sequences of interest. You might be able to order an off-the-shelf pre-designed library for this (popular libraries include Avana, Yusa v1.1, and TKOv3); you might have to design a library of your own. While we won't cover the custom gRNA library design process in detail here, I'd personally recommend looking at the [CRISPRverse](https://github.com/crisprVerse/Tutorials/tree/master) collection of R packages. They have several helpful tutorials that walk you through custom gRNA library design.\n",

        "You will now need to deliver your guide RNA library into your cells of interest. A popular means for doing this is to package your library into lentiviral vectors and then transduce your cells. If you aim for a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), you should be able to effectively introduce a single guide RNA into each cell in the population. This avoids the possibility of double cuts and\n",

        "\n",
        "You can now subject your diversified cell population to some sort of selective pressure. This might be just survival in the presence of CRISPR-Cas9, survival in the presence of a drug, or the expression of a fluorescent reporter (measured with a flow cytometer). Typically, you would culture cells for multiple passages under selection to allow time for CRISPR-mediated genetic modifications and to amplify phenotypic effects.\n",

If you perform high-throughput sequencing to quantify gRNA abundance, you can then compare guide RNA counts in a selected and control population of cells. This should reveal which guides (and by proxy which target sequences) are associated with the phenotype.\n",

        "Summarising across genes in MAGECK is achieved using a technique called Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA). RRA organises guides into a list according to their *p-value* for depletion or enrichment. In the figure below, this means that the most significantly depleted guides (with the smallest *p-values*) are placed on the left-hand side of the list. The algorithm then looks for genes whose guides are not evenly distributed throughout the list (e.g., a gene whose guides are all perturbed, with *p-values* clustered on the left-hand side).\n",

        "In this experiment, we used a \"T0\" pre-screen sample derived from a **transduced cell population** for our comparisons. However, it has been observed that using a sample of the **plasmid library** intended for transfection might be a superior reference. When researchers compared the counts of gRNAs targeting essential genes in plasmid and T0 samples, they found that essential gene guide counts were already reduced at T0 (Imkeller, K., Ambrosi, G., Boutros, M. et al, 2020). This suggests that gene editing can occur quickly and means that some of the essential gene depletion scores in our screen might be underestimates!\n",

This reduces diversity in the cell population you are screening and can artificially increase the apparent depletion of rare guides in your experiment (see Figure 7). This could result in some guides being spuriously identified as essential and other guides being identified as enriched. The authors of gscreend suggest using it as your CRIPSR analysis tool might help mitigate this effect, but it's also important to consider how often and how severely you passage your cells during a screen.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Given a CRISPR counts matrix, you can use data wrangling tools like R or Python to quickly verify that sequencing samples meet your expectations.\n",
        "- You'd expect samples to have similar overall guide distributions and similar total sequencing read.\n",
        "- You can use tools such as MAGECK, BAGEL2, and gscreend to identify depleted or enriched guides in an experiment.\n",
        "- These tools perform contrasts that compare guide RNA abundances in treatment vs. control samples and then aggregate this data at the gene level.\n",
        "- By including positive and negative control genes in your guide RNA library, you can use metrics like NNMD to validate the success of a screen.\n",
        "- Experimental and genomic factors may confound your experiment—so try to keep these in mind.\n",
