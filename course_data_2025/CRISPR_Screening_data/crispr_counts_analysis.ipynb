        "The aim of this practical class is to introduce you to some of the concepts and tools involved in the analysis of pooled CRISPR screens. We will begin by taking a set of pre-generated CRISPR counts data and exploring it in R. Then, we will process the dataset to identify essential genes in a cell line using a two popular tools: MAGeCK and BAGEL2. Finally, we will explore some of the pitfalls that you might need to considere when interpeting the results of CRISPR screening experiments.\n",

        "Throughout this course, you will hopefully have seen how CRISPR systems can be applied as powerful tools for cellular manipulation. Depending on how they are configured, CRISPR systems can be used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Introduce double-stranded breaks at a genomic locus\n",
        "- Introduce sequence modifications to a locus\n",
        "- Recruit functional domains to that locus\n",
        "- Modulate gene expression (activation with CRISPRa and inhibition with CRISPRi)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "CRISPR screens attempt to perform these manipulations at scale: interrogating thousands of genomic features (genes, promoters, enhancers *etc.*) simultaneously. **Pooled screens** enable us to achieve this within a single population of cells, hugely simplifying candidate gene discovery.\n",

        "### The CRISPR screening process\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of conducting a pooled CRISPR screen is illustrated below in Figure 1. Essentially, we aim to deliver a \"library\" of guide RNAs into a population of cells expressing Cas9 and observe the effects. It can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "🧬 **Design** 🧬\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we construct a library of guide RNAs that target your sequences of interest. You might be able to order an off-the-shelf pre-designed library for this (popular libraries include Avana, Yusa v1.1, and TKOv3); you might have to design and synthesise a library of your own. While we won't cover the custom gRNA library design process in detail in this session, I'd recommend looking at the [CRISPRverse](https://github.com/crisprVerse/Tutorials/tree/master) collection of R packages. They have several helpful tutorials that walk you through custom gRNA library design.\n",
        "\n",
        "📦 **Delivery** 📦\n",
        "\n",
        "You will now need to deliver your guide RNA library into your cells of interest. A popular means for doing this is to package your library into lentiviral vectors and then transduce your cells. If you aim for a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), you should be able to effectively introduce a single guide RNA into each cell in the population. This reduces the possibility of cells recieving multiple guides and double cutting events.\n",
        "\n",
        " 🥼 **Cell Culture and Phenotypic Selection** 🥼\n",
        "\n",
        "You can now subject your diversified cell population to some sort of selective pressure. This might be just survival in the presence of CRISPR-Cas9, survival in the presence of a drug, or the expression of a fluorescent reporter (measured with a flow cytometer). Typically, you would culture cells for multiple passages under selection to allow time for CRISPR-mediated genetic modifications and to amplify phenotypic effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "💻 **Genomic DNA Extraction and Sequencing** 💻\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, you will need to amplify guide plasmid DNA from both your selected and control cell populations using PCR. If you perform high-throughput sequencing to quantify gRNA abundance, you can then compare guide RNA counts in a selected and control population of cells. This should reveal which guides (and by proxy which target sequences) are associated with the phenotype.\n",

        "Summarising across genes in MAGECK is achieved using a technique called Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA). RRA organises guides into a list according to their *p-value* for depletion or enrichment. In the figure below, this means that the most significantly depleted guides (with the smallest *p-values*) are placed on the left-hand side of the list. The algorithm then looks for genes whose guides are not evenly distributed throughout the list (e.g., a gene whose guides are all perturbed, with *p-values* clustered on the left-hand side).\n",

However, it has been observed that using a sample of the **plasmid library** intended for transfection might be a superior reference. When researchers compared the counts of gRNAs targeting essential genes in plasmid and T0 samples, they found that essential gene guide counts were already reduced at T0 (Imkeller, K., Ambrosi, G., Boutros, M. et al, 2020). This suggests that gene editing can occur quickly and means that some of the essential gene depletion scores in our screen might be underestimates!"

        "In many ways, we've only just scratched the surface, and there's plenty more to explore. You might want to dive into topics such as pre-filtering low-count guides from the dataset, identifying problematic samples using tools like a Principal Component Analysis, or performing multi-factorial analysis with tools like MAGECK-MLE. Alternatively, you can often reach out to a friendly bioinformatician for some assistance. Either way — happy screening!\n",

        "- Given a CRISPR counts matrix, you can use data wrangling tools like R or Python to quickly verify that sequencing samples meet your expectations.\n",
        "- You'd expect samples to have similar overall guide distributions and similar total sequencing read.\n",
        "- You can use tools such as MAGECK, BAGEL2, and gscreend to identify depleted or enriched guides in an experiment.\n",
        "- These tools perform contrasts that compare guide RNA abundances in treatment vs. control samples and then aggregate this data at the gene level.\n",
        "- By including positive and negative control genes in your guide RNA library, you can use metrics like NNMD to validate the success of a screen.\n",
        "- Experimental and genomic factors may confound your experiment—so try to keep these in mind.\n",
