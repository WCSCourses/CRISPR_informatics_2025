        "The aim of this practical class is to introduce you to some of the concepts and tools involved in the analysis of pooled CRISPR screens. We will begin by taking a set of pre-generated CRISPR counts data and exploring it in R. Then, we will process the dataset to identify essential genes in a cell line using a two popular tools: MAGeCK and BAGEL2. Finally, we will explore some of the pitfalls that you might need to considere when interpeting the results of CRISPR screening experiments.\n",

        "Throughout this course, you will hopefully have seen how CRISPR systems can be applied as powerful tools for cellular manipulation. Depending on how they are configured, CRISPR systems can be used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Introduce double-stranded breaks at a genomic locus\n",
        "- Introduce sequence modifications to a locus\n",
        "- Recruit functional domains to that locus\n",
        "- Modulate gene expression (activation with CRISPRa and inhibition with CRISPRi)\n",

        "\n",
        "The process of conducting a pooled CRISPR screen is illustrated below in Figure 1. Essentially, we aim to deliver a \"library\" of guide RNAs into a population of cells expressing Cas9 and observe the effects. It can be broken down into the following steps:\n",

        "ðŸ§¬ **Design** ðŸ§¬\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we construct a library of guide RNAs that target your sequences of interest. You might be able to order an off-the-shelf pre-designed library for this (popular libraries include Avana, Yusa v1.1, and TKOv3); you might have to design and synthesise a library of your own. While we won't cover the custom gRNA library design process in detail in this session, I'd recommend looking at the [CRISPRverse](https://github.com/crisprVerse/Tutorials/tree/master) collection of R packages. They have several helpful tutorials that walk you through custom gRNA library design.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“¦ **Delivery** ðŸ“¦\n",
        "\n",
        "You will now need to deliver your guide RNA library into your cells of interest. A popular means for doing this is to package your library into lentiviral vectors and then transduce your cells. If you aim for a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), you should be able to effectively introduce a single guide RNA into each cell in the population. This reduces the possibility of cells recieving multiple guides and double cutting events.\n",
        "\n",
        " ðŸ¥¼ **Cell Culture and Phenotypic Selection** ðŸ¥¼\n",
        "\n",
        "You can now subject your diversified cell population to some sort of selective pressure. This might be just survival in the presence of CRISPR-Cas9, survival in the presence of a drug, or the expression of a fluorescent reporter (measured with a flow cytometer). Typically, you would culture cells for multiple passages under selection to allow time for CRISPR-mediated genetic modifications and to amplify phenotypic effects.\n",

        "ðŸ’» **Genomic DNA Extraction and Sequencing** ðŸ’»\n",

If you perform high-throughput sequencing to quantify gRNA abundance, you can then compare guide RNA counts in a selected and control population of cells. This should reveal which guides (and by proxy which target sequences) are associated with the phenotype.\n",
