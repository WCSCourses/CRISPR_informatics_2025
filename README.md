# CRISPR genome engineering for cellular modelling and screening 

## 28 July – 1 August 2025, Virtual Course

[Wellcome Connecting Science Course Website Link](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/event/crispr-genome-engineering-for-cellular-modelling-and-screening-2024-20241007/) <br /> 
[Course Time Table 2024](https://github.com/WCSCourses/CRISPR_Informatics_2024/blob/main/WCS_CRISPR_Timetable2024.pdf) <br /> 

# Summary

Pooled and arrayed CRISPR screens have diverse clinical and research applications. Arrayed screening involves targeted gene editing for investigating specific gene function and biological pathways, whereas pooled screening enables a rapid high-throughput global approach to gene discovery.

The programme will be delivered as a combination of lectures, interactive tutorials, hands-on laboratory and computer practical sessions, workshops, and seminars focused on three therapeutic areas where pooled and arrayed screens are used, namely:

- Oncology
- Neurodegeneration
- Immunology

Additionally, for each component of the course, a group project will be completed to aid in achievement of the learning objectives.

The course content will be delivered in English.

# Target Audience

Applicants should be postdoctoral scientists, advanced PhD students actively engaged in or soon to commence relevant research. It is also suitable for facility managers and principal investigators wishing to bring the latest genetic technologies into their facilities or groups.

# Programme

Upon completion of this course, participants should be able to:

- Design and execute CRISPR based genetic screening approaches in both pooled and arrayed formats
- Understand CRISPR-based genetic screening methods, including design, reagents, and techniques including their advantages and limitations
- Perform CRISPR screening analysis using available tools and resources
