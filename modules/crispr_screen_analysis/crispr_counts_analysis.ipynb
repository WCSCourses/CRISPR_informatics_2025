        "\n",
        "The aim of this practical class is to introduce you to some of the concepts and tools involved in the analysis of pooled CRISPR screens. Will we begin by taking set of pre-generated CRISPR counts data and exploring it in R. Then, we will process the dataset to identify essential genes in a cell line using a popular tool called MAGECK. Finally, we will explore some alternative tools for CRIPSR screen analyis and discuss some of pitfalls that you might need to be wary of in these kinds of experiment.\n",

        "## Background\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this course we have seen how CRISPR systems can applied as powerful tools for cellular manipulation. Depending on how they are configured, CRISPR systems can be used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Introduce double standed breaks at a genomic locus\n",
        "- Introduce sequence modifications to a locus\n",
        "- Recruit funcitonal domains to that locus\n",
        "- Modulate gene expression (activiation with CRISPRa and inhibition with CRISPRi)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "CRIPSR screens attempt to perform these manipulations at scale: interrogating thousands of genomic features (genes, promoters, enhancers *etc.*) simultaneously. Pooled screens enable us to achieve this within a single population of cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "### The CRISPR screening process\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of conducting a pooled CRISPR screen is illustrated below in Figure 1. Essentially, we aim to deliver a \"library\" of guide RNAs into population of cells experessing Cas9 and observe the effects. It can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "🧬 **Design** 🧬\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we prepare a library of guide RNAs that target your sequences of interest. You might be able to order an off-the-shelf pre-deisgned library for this (popular libraries include Yusa, GeCkO and TKO); you might have to design a library of your own. Whilst we won't cover the custom gRNA library design process in detail here, I'd personally recommend looking at the [CRISPRverse](https://github.com/crisprVerse/Tutorials/tree/master) collection of R packages. They have several helpful tutorials that walk you through library design.\n",
        "\n",
        "📦 **Delivery** 📦\n",
        "\n",
        "You will now need to deliver your guide library into your cells of interest. A popular means for doing this is to package your library into lentiviral vectors and then transduce your cells. If you aim for a low mutliplicity of infection (MOI) you should be able to effectively introduce a single guide RNA into each cell in the population.\n",
        "\n",
        " 🥼 **Cell Culture and Phenotypic Selection** 🥼\n",
        "\n",
        "You can now subject your diversified cell population to some sort of selective pressure. This might be just be survival in the presence of CRISPR-Cas9, survival in the presence of a drug, or the expression of a fluorescent reporter (measured with a flow cytometer). Typically you would culture cells for multiple passages under selection to allow time for CRISPR-mediated genetic modifications and to amplify phenotypic effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "💻 **Genomic DNA Extraction and Sequencing** 💻\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, you will need to amplfy gRNA DNA from both selected and control cell populations using PCR. If you perform high-throughput sequencing to quantify gRNA abundance you can then compare guide RNA counts in a selected and control population of cells. This should reveal which guides (and by proxy which target sequences) are associated with the phenotype.\n",

RRA organises CRISPR guides in a list according to the *p-value* for their depletion/enrichment. In the figure below this would mean the most significantly depleted guides are placed at the left hand side of the list.The algorithm then looks for genes whose guides are not evenly distributed throughout the list (*e.g.* a gene who's guides are all depleted or are all strongly enriched)\n",

BAGEL2 calculates \"Bayes Factors\" to represent gene essentiality. It builds a classifier using NEG and CEG behaviours and assigns genes with unknown essentiality to one of these classes with a probability estiamte. In some scenarios BAGEL has better sensitivity to detect essential genes and it's latest version can better accounts for the off-target effects of guide RNAs on cell survival.

There have been suggestions that a sample of the plasmid library to be used in the transfection might be superior reference. It has been observed that gRNAs targeting essential genes already have their abundance reduced at T0 - so some of the essential gene depletions in our screen might be underestimates!\n",

        "**Bottlenecking**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Several studies have demonstrated that targeting Cas9 to regions where there are copy number gains will cause multiple DNA double-strand breaks and induce a larger gene-independent DNA-damage response. This causes the cells to enter cell-cycle arrest and the net effect of this is that regions with copy number amplifications are much more likely to deplete and appear as essential in CRISPR knockout screens.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several tools have been built to mitigate this effect. MAGECK, for instance has an inbuilt copy-number adjustment tool that controls for CNA's. Alternatively, [CRISPRcleanR](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/tool/crisprcleanr/) applies circular binary segmentation algorithm to identify genomic regions where sgRNA impact is correlated. This algorithm works on the basis that contigous genes should not be equally essential and attributes situations where this phenomenon is observed to being a copy number alteration."
